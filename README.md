#### A JS Exercise for Epicodus, June 2, 2016

#### By **Maldon Meehan and Halle Williams**

## Description
Make a web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. Here are the definitions of each possibility:

* Equilateral: All sides are equal.
* Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
* Scalene: No sides are equal.
* NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.
